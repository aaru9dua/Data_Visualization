About You
You relish meaningful work. At ATLAS, we are a small business, so the work you do will have a noticeable and disproportionate impact on our success. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.

Partner with each of our executives and department directors to identify optimization opportunities, deploy data collection and monitoring tools, and present findings to the COO and executive team on an ongoing basis.
Identify data champions throughout the company that you can train to assist in data collection, analysis, and monitoring so that our business intelligence and analysis efforts scale as we continue to grow.
Pursue personally rewarding projects or challenges that you identify as critical to the success of the organization.
Day-to-Day

Develop and provide training for our team on any of the activities listed above.
Success In this Role
In this role, you will have the opportunity to work alongside experienced CMMC consultants who will support you in areas where you may lack immediate capabilities or experience.
So whether you’re a seasoned or a more junior IT professional, your experience, or desire to grow, in each of the following areas will be the keys to your success in this role:
Influence strategic decision-making by providing data-driven insights and analysis. Your success will be determined by your ability to translate data into compelling and actionable presentations for senior leadership.
Support the growth of a dynamic organization by scaling analytics capabilities and identifying opportunities for improvement.
Develop personnel capabilities that sustain continuous improvement activities as the company scales. Success is creating an analytics function that thrives beyond your tenure.
Implement process improvements that drive measurable gains in productivity and cost savings. Success will be achieving optimization goals that significantly benefit the bottom line.
Lead technology implementations that tangibly improve business operations and performance.
Identify improvement opportunities that keep the company operating at peak efficiency during rapid growth.
Generate disproportionate value by pursuing passion projects aligned to company goals and moving the needle on objectives you deem critical to our success.

Influence strategic decision-making by providing data-driven insights and analysis. Your success will be determined by your ability to translate data into compelling and actionable presentations for senior leadership.
Support the growth of a dynamic organization by scaling analytics capabilities and identifying opportunities for improvement.
Develop personnel capabilities that sustain continuous improvement activities as the company scales. Success is creating an analytics function that thrives beyond your tenure.
