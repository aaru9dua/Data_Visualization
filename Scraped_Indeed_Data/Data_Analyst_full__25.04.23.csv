ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary

401k with up to 4% company match
Professional development funding

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary
Medical, dental, and vision coverage
401k with up to 4% company match
Professional development funding

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process.

Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER

Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary

Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.

Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
