These services will be composed of backend components that are operational or analytical and simple web interfaces as the front end.
To be considered for this position you must have past software engineering experience involving processing or creating any one or more of the following: 1) BGP route or flowspec announcements, 2) BGP routing table data, 3) sflow/netflow data, 4) a system that produced geoip data (not just a client that used geoip data).
Ideally you know a suitable low level backend language such as C, Go, or Rust that can be used to write or otherwise modify existing BGP daemon (for making or ingesting BGP announcements/withdrawals) or sflow/netflow processing daemons, and a few scripting languages (for easier programming tasks, such as making quick web based tools for our staff, customers, or the public). Also you are expected to have a working knowledge of SQL as well as any other database languages you prefer to use depending on the situation.
Hurricane Electric's Internet backbone network connects to over 9200 networks in 45 countries.
Our customers are Internet companies and large Internet networks.

These services will be composed of backend components that are operational or analytical and simple web interfaces as the front end.
To be considered for this position you must have past software engineering experience involving processing or creating any one or more of the following: 1) BGP route or flowspec announcements, 2) BGP routing table data, 3) sflow/netflow data, 4) a system that produced geoip data (not just a client that used geoip data).
Ideally you know a suitable low level backend language such as C, Go, or Rust that can be used to write or otherwise modify existing BGP daemon (for making or ingesting BGP announcements/withdrawals) or sflow/netflow processing daemons, and a few scripting languages (for easier programming tasks, such as making quick web based tools for our staff, customers, or the public). Also you are expected to have a working knowledge of SQL as well as any other database languages you prefer to use depending on the situation.
Hurricane Electric's Internet backbone network connects to over 9200 networks in 45 countries.
Our customers are Internet companies and large Internet networks.

Knowledge of C, Go, or Rust required (to be able to write low level code to speak or ingest BGP or sflow messages).
Knowledge of PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, or Javascript a plus.
Because this is a programming job, there will be one or more reasonable coding assessments. We apologize in advance for needing you to do this, we get many applicants with a very wide range of experience and competency. You can't tell just by looking at somebody's degree or by their communication skills during an interview whether they can program.
Must have prior work experience using SQL and Linux.
2+ years of experience working directly or indirectly with networks in a 24x7 production environment a plus.

276,sj_1aa99ca587063f4b,Network Engineer,"Software Engineer (Remote) - Network Protocols BGP, Sflow, geoip, SSL/TLS",Hurricane Electric,Remote,"Leading Internet backbone Hurricane Electric seeks a Network Software Engineer to work on several Internet network related software projects involving BGP, BGP flow spec, sflow, netflow, and global Internet routing analysis. These services will be composed of backend components that are operational or analytical and simple web interfaces as the front end.
To be considered for this position you must have past software engineering experience involving processing or creating any one or more of the following: 1) BGP route or flowspec announcements, 2) BGP routing table data, 3) sflow/netflow data, 4) a system that produced geoip data (not just a client that used geoip data).
Ideally you know a suitable low level backend language such as C, Go, or Rust that can be used to write or otherwise modify existing BGP daemon (for making or ingesting BGP announcements/withdrawals) or sflow/netflow processing daemons, and a few scripting languages (for easier programming tasks, such as making quick web based tools for our staff, customers, or the public). Also you are expected to have a working knowledge of SQL as well as any other database languages you prefer to use depending on the situation.
Hurricane Electric's Internet backbone network connects to over 9200 networks in 45 countries.
Our customers are Internet companies and large Internet networks.
We develop and maintain tools for network engineers to use such as: http://bgp.he.net http://lg.he.net http://he.net/layer2 http://he.net/3d-map
Responsibilities:
Write a simple web interface front end and a network protocol related (i.e. BGP, sflow, etc) back end for several different Network Software projects.
Requirements:
2+ years software engineering involving BGP, BGP flowspec, and/or sflow/netflow
4+ years software engineering
Solid knowledge of UNIX and TCP/IP network fundamentals
Practical knowledge of protocols such as: IPv6, ARP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP, SSH, SNMP
Knowledge of C, Go, or Rust required (to be able to write low level code to speak or ingest BGP or sflow messages).
Knowledge of PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, or Javascript a plus.
Because this is a programming job, there will be one or more reasonable coding assessments. We apologize in advance for needing you to do this, we get many applicants with a very wide range of experience and competency. You can't tell just by looking at somebody's degree or by their communication skills during an interview whether they can program.
Must have prior work experience using SQL and Linux.
2+ years of experience working directly or indirectly with networks in a 24x7 production environment a plus.
Experience working directly or indirectly with Cisco, Juniper, Extreme/Brocade, or Arista routers and switches a plus.
Hands-on experience with network diagnostic tools such as ping, traceroute, mtr, iperf, dig, and whois
Possess excellent verbal/written (English) communication skills

These services will be composed of backend components that are operational or analytical and simple web interfaces as the front end.
To be considered for this position you must have past software engineering experience involving processing or creating any one or more of the following: 1) BGP route or flowspec announcements, 2) BGP routing table data, 3) sflow/netflow data, 4) a system that produced geoip data (not just a client that used geoip data).
Ideally you know a suitable low level backend language such as C, Go, or Rust that can be used to write or otherwise modify existing BGP daemon (for making or ingesting BGP announcements/withdrawals) or sflow/netflow processing daemons, and a few scripting languages (for easier programming tasks, such as making quick web based tools for our staff, customers, or the public). Also you are expected to have a working knowledge of SQL as well as any other database languages you prefer to use depending on the situation.
Hurricane Electric's Internet backbone network connects to over 9200 networks in 45 countries.
Our customers are Internet companies and large Internet networks.
We develop and maintain tools for network engineers to use such as: http://bgp.he.net http://lg.he.net http://he.net/layer2 http://he.net/3d-map

Knowledge of PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, or Javascript a plus.
Because this is a programming job, there will be one or more reasonable coding assessments. We apologize in advance for needing you to do this, we get many applicants with a very wide range of experience and competency. You can't tell just by looking at somebody's degree or by their communication skills during an interview whether they can program.
Must have prior work experience using SQL and Linux.
2+ years of experience working directly or indirectly with networks in a 24x7 production environment a plus.
Experience working directly or indirectly with Cisco, Juniper, Extreme/Brocade, or Arista routers and switches a plus.
