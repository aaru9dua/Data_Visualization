ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary
Medical, dental, and vision coverage
401k with up to 4% company match
Professional development funding
Fun and flexible work environment

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary
Medical, dental, and vision coverage
401k with up to 4% company match
Professional development funding
Fun and flexible work environment
Juristat is an equal-opportunity employer. We're excited to work with people no matter their race, color, creed, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, pregnancy status, or mental or physical disability.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition. We're a highly collaborative team, both internally and across other teams, so being a teammate and an effective communicator are important for success in our team.

ABOUT JURISTAT
We believe the key to that success is building a team of self-motivated, curious people who get things done.
We don’t care what you wear to work, what you look like, or if you prefer to work remotely forever. All we care about is that you have an unflinching drive to do your best.
“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office
Flexible personal leave policy
Competitive salary
Medical, dental, and vision coverage
401k with up to 4% company match
Professional development funding
Fun and flexible work environment

ABOUT JURISTAT

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.
Obtaining a U.S. patent is a springboard to innovation. But the process can be time-consuming and expensive. We aim to remove as much guesswork as possible from the patent application process. And since 2012, law firms and corporate legal teams have trusted Juristat’s data analytics and workflow automation solutions to do just that.
Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.
WHAT WE OFFER
We enjoy working in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. We all agree to follow a code of conduct. Additionally, we show our team members that we value them by offering the following:
Remote position with no pressure to ever come back to the office

Bloomberg Law is changing the legal industry by delivering the most sophisticated research platform on the market with a focus on automation, analytics and real-time answers! Our goal is to become an indispensable tool for legal professionals by supporting their day-to-day tasks and providing solutions that help them get real-time answers and better serve their clients.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition. We're a highly collaborative team, both internally and across other teams, so being a teammate and an effective communicator are important for success in our team.

What's In it for you:

Bloomberg Law is changing the legal industry by delivering the most sophisticated research platform on the market with a focus on automation, analytics and real-time answers! Our goal is to become an indispensable tool for legal professionals by supporting their day-to-day tasks and providing solutions that help them get real-time answers and better serve their clients.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition. We're a highly collaborative team, both internally and across other teams, so being a teammate and an effective communicator are important for success in our team.

What's In it for you:
As part of our team, you will be developing machine learning (ML) models to our business needs. You will drive, design and develop machine learning solutions. A right combination of cross-field ML techniques, deep understanding of the business problem and high-quality training data is fundamental to our models producing high quality models for our client's needs. You will collaborate with product managers and legal domain experts to understand business problems and map them to ML problems. You will research groundbreaking ML/NLP techniques and apply them to our business problems. You will collaborate with legal domain experts to gain valuable insights and use their legal expertise to get high quality annotated training data. You will closely be working with product owners, legal data analysts (our domain experts), data engineers and front-end engineers to build and integrate ML solutions to our product.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Bloomberg Law is changing the legal industry by delivering the most sophisticated research platform on the market with a focus on automation, analytics and real-time answers! Our goal is to become an indispensable tool for legal professionals by supporting their day-to-day tasks and providing solutions that help them get real-time answers and better serve their clients.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.

Bloomberg Law is changing the legal industry by delivering the most sophisticated research platform on the market with a focus on automation, analytics and real-time answers! Our goal is to become an indispensable tool for legal professionals by supporting their day-to-day tasks and providing solutions that help them get real-time answers and better serve their clients.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition. We're a highly collaborative team, both internally and across other teams, so being a teammate and an effective communicator are important for success in our team.

What's In it for you:
As part of our team, you will be developing machine learning (ML) models to our business needs. You will drive, design and develop machine learning solutions. A right combination of cross-field ML techniques, deep understanding of the business problem and high-quality training data is fundamental to our models producing high quality models for our client's needs. You will collaborate with product managers and legal domain experts to understand business problems and map them to ML problems. You will research groundbreaking ML/NLP techniques and apply them to our business problems. You will collaborate with legal domain experts to gain valuable insights and use their legal expertise to get high quality annotated training data. You will closely be working with product owners, legal data analysts (our domain experts), data engineers and front-end engineers to build and integrate ML solutions to our product.

The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

213,sj_d7670e4b2fda9de0,Data Scientist,Machine Learning Engineer - Bloomberg Law,Bloomberg,"New York, NY 10261","Our Team:
Bloomberg Law is changing the legal industry by delivering the most sophisticated research platform on the market with a focus on automation, analytics and real-time answers! Our goal is to become an indispensable tool for legal professionals by supporting their day-to-day tasks and providing solutions that help them get real-time answers and better serve their clients.

Within Bloomberg Law (BLAW), the BLAW Machine Learning Team is the central machine learning engineering team working with groundbreaking technologies to build data-driven customer-facing products using Natural language processing (NLP), Information extraction (IE) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as named entity disambiguation, text classification, clustering and topical modeling, text summarization and personalized recommendations. Our current focus is on legal research and contract drafting tools designed to speed up those tasks for legal professionals by letting AI do the heavy-lifting. These tools let users upload a document, then automatically classify it, structure its contents and analyze the text by identifying topics, extracting entities and suggesting other relevant documents. Some of the specific problems we are working on this year include summarizing legal content, extracting case outcomes from court dockets or data mined from legal contracts. To solve these, we use both traditional methods as well as techniques such as attention-based deep neural networks, deep language models. We work closely with product managers, software engineers and legal domain experts using agile development.

In general Machine Learning projects have an intrinsic dose of uncertainty, so a good fit for our team is a person who is self-motivated, proactive, comfortable dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in task definition. We're a highly collaborative team, both internally and across other teams, so being a teammate and an effective communicator are important for success in our team.

What's In it for you:
As part of our team, you will be developing machine learning (ML) models to our business needs. You will drive, design and develop machine learning solutions. A right combination of cross-field ML techniques, deep understanding of the business problem and high-quality training data is fundamental to our models producing high quality models for our client's needs.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.

In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Location: This role is in-person in either New York City or Boston.

Basis (https://www.basis.ai/) is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Role
Research scientists lead Basis’ efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.
We expect you to:
Have demonstrated an ability to do scientific research that is of high-quality. Possible ways to demonstrate this include publications, technical reports, and software projects.
In addition, the following would be an advantage:
PhD (or equivalent experience) in technical areas, including: statistics, programming languages, machine learning, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, physics, mathematics.
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.
Responsibilities
Develop and explore computational theories of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
In close collaboration with domain experts inside and especially outside Basis, work as a team member to help solve scientific and societal problems
Distill insights from solving problems into more general mathematical and computational theories
Develop and maintain open-source software
(Optionally) Publish and present findings in journals and conferences
Contribute to the culture and direction of Basis
Role Details
Exceptional candidates who may not meet all of the following criteria are still encouraged to apply.
FT/PT: This is a full-time position
Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
